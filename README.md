Should I drive tommorow in Sarajevo?

Please git clone this repo, then:
- open shouldIDriveTomorrow.js file
- copy/paste the code in browser's console
- replace the default registration string with your own
- if you get "true", you're free to drive your wheels, otherwise, take a walk in fresh and cold smog.

That's it!
